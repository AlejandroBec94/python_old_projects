Once upon a time, a merchant that, before departing for a long business trip, called for his three daughters to ask them what they wanted him to bring for a gift. The first asked for a dress of brocade, the second a string of pearls and third, that was named Bella and was the most courteous, told her father: It is enough to have a rose cut with your hands. The merchant departed and, once his affairs were ended, he set out to turn around when a storm caught him unawares and unprepared.
